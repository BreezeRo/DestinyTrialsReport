            Support charity and get a badge of your choice on your player card, for example <span class="player-hazard player-hazard--border player-hazard--charity2">Philantropist</span>, <span class="player-hazard player-hazard--border player-hazard--charity3">Saint</span>or <span class="player-hazard player-hazard--border player-hazard--charity4">Hero</span>! This is how it works:

          <ol>
            <li>We pick a different charity each week</li>
            <li>
              You donate an amount of at least $50 through PayPal
              <ul class="faded">
                <li>We donate the entire amount minus $10 to the charity of the week</li>
                <li>Why the large amount? We want to make sure a custom badge is something special without polluting every card. This is a pilot though, so we might tweak the amount in the future.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Along with your donation you pick
              <ul>
                <li>The word you want for your badge (maximum of 14 characters)</li>
                <li>A color you like</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We check whether your badge meets all our requirements.<br><span class="faded">We have spent some time on the internet, this is to filter out stuff like <span class="player-hazard player-hazard--border player-hazard--none">Dickbutt</span></span></li>
            <li>Give us some time to implement your custom badge and show it to aaall your friends! <span class="faded">You will most likely have it by the next Trials weekend.</span></li>
