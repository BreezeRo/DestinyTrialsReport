      We have recently made some friends over at <a href="https://Guardian.gg" target="_top">Guardian.gg</a>,
      they love to collect all kinds of data and agreed to let us use anything we want to make our site more useful for you.<br/>
      All they want in exchange is for you to <a href="https://Guardian.gg" target="_top">visit</a> and let them
      know what kind of data and content you would like to see more of.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now nothing much has changed, we have replaced the Bungie rating with a custom
      <a href="https://guardian.gg/en/faq" target="_top">Elo rating</a> that is calculated in-house by Guardian.gg<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are planning some big updates coming up so stay tuned and good luck this week Guardians!
